### Original project : [MaximePremont/EpitechCriterionAction](https://github.com/MaximePremont/EpitechCriterionActions)

Epitech Criterion Actions Example is a simple C project serving as an example concerning the organization of the project and the Makefile for the use of [Epitech Criterion Actions](https://github.com/MaximePremont/EpitechCriterionActions) and for all Epitech projects wich use unit tests.

This example C project has the functionality of displaying the number of letters contained in each word passed as an argument. For this, a "[my_strlen](https://github.com/MaximePremont/EpitechCriterionActions_Example/blob/master/sources/my_strlen.c)" function ( reproducing the operation of "[strlen](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html)" ) is used, and therefore tested with [Criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html).

## Exemple
### All the results are displayed in the ["epitech-criterion-actions" branch](https://github.com/MaximePremont/EpitechCriterionActions_Example/tree/epitech-criterion-actions)
